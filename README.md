# Readme
This is a small hobby project were I try to create a blend from
a few very closely related games.
For the economical side I would like to combine "Settlers 3", "Settlers 4"
and the "Cultures"-series.
For the competitive side I would like to take some inspirations from
"Stronghold" and the "Cultures"-series.
Combining the skills and equipments systems from "Cultures" and "Spellforce"
I hope to create a very elegant economy heavy RTS with RPG elements.

At the moment I am collecting my ideas and writing them down.
While also slowly beginning to lay foundations for the code.

If you have an idea or wish to contribute please create an issue on the page.
