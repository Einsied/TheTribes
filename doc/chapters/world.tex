\chapter{The world}\label{ch:World}

The tribes you will play in is settled by different
\hyperref[ch:Tribes]{tribes}. These dwell together with wild animals, great
beasts and precious resources in the forests, jungles, grasslands and deserts
of the world.

To protect themselves from the elements and their opponents most of them chose
to erect great fortified cities and build thriving economies, governed by their
unique approach to the problems of the world and the deities they do or do not
worship.

To lead your chosen tribe to greatness you should learn about it, the other
tribes and the world they inhabit. This document is supposed to support you to
do this.
