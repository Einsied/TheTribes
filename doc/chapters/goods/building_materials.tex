\section{Building materials}\label{ch:Goods:Materials}

The different \hyperref[ch:Tribes]{tribes} build with various materials. These
come into different categories like stone and quality levels, so we can have
stones, stone blocks, polished stone blocks and engraved stone blocks. Quality
is always improved by a specialized craftsmen, so to transform a stone into a
stone-block a mason and some time is necessary. To transform boards into
painted boards a painter and paint is necessary. Lower qualities can be
substituted by higher quality, so instead of a stone block a polished or
engraved stone block can be used. During the building process a substituted
material is degraded into lower quality, so if the building is torn down only
the lower quality material can be returned.

Let us now take a look at the different material and quality levels.
\begin{longtable}{ccccc}
	\toprule
	Material & Level 1      & Level 2     & Level 3        & Level 4        \\
	\midrule
	Rock     & Stone        & Stone block & Polished block & Engraved block \\
	Wood     & \Gls{Timber} & Lumber      & Boards         & Painted Boards \\
	\bottomrule
\end{longtable}
