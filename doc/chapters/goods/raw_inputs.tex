\section{Natures bounty}\label{ch:Goods:Nature}

The world is rich in countless natural resources the
\hyperref[ch:Tribes]{tribes} can use. They can be categorized in according to
their source. Some come from \hyperref[ch:World:Inhabitants:Animals]{animals},
some from the \hyperref[ch:World:Minerals]{ground} and some from
\hyperref[ch:World:Plants]{plants}. They and their sources are discussed here.

\subsection{Plants}\label{ch:Goods:Nature:Plants}

The world is home to a wide variety of \hyperref[ch:World:Plants]{plants}.
These can be \emph{harvested} for a variety of goods, killing them in the
process, or kept alive to yield \emph{fruits} over their lifetime.

\begin{longtable}{lll}
	\toprule
	Good           & Fruit              & Harvest                                                   \\
	\midrule
	\Gls{Herb}     &                    & \Gls{Plant:Herb}                                          \\
	\Gls{Mushroom} &                    & \Gls{Plant:Mushroom}                                      \\

	\Gls{Chestnut} & \Gls{ChestnutTree} &                                                           \\
	\Gls{Timber}   &                    & \Gls{Fir}, \gls{Oak}, \gls{AppleTree}, \gls{ChestnutTree} \\
	\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Animals}\label{ch:Goods:Nature:Animals}

Within the world there are countless
\hyperref[ch:World:Inhabitants:Animals]{wild animals}. These can be hunted and
butchered for different goods. They are also joined by the
\hyperref[ch:World:Inhabitants:Livestock]{livestock} that the
\hyperref[ch:Tribes]{tribes} keep. The goods and from which animal they can be
sourced are found here.

\begin{longtable}{ll}
	\toprule
	Good       & Sources                \\
	\midrule
	\Gls{Hide} & \Gls{Boar}, \gls{Deer} \\
	\Gls{Meat} & \Gls{Boar}, \gls{Deer} \\
	\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{The sea}\label{ch:Goods:Nature:Sea}

The seas teem with life. The fish within them are caught by the fishers for
sustenance.

\subsection{Minerals}\label{ch:Goods:Nature:Minerals}

Within the worlds above the ground valuable resources often appear agglomerated
within nodes. From these nodes these \hyperref[ch:World:Minerals]{minerals} can
be mined.

\paragraph{\Glsfmttext{Stone}}

\Gls*{Stone} can be directly mined and then used as a
\hyperref[ch:Goods:Materials]{building material}
or for the production of other goods.

\paragraph{\Glsfmttext{CopperOre}}

\Gls*{CopperOre} is used to make the softest metal used for \glspl{Weapon}, \glspl{Tool} and \glspl{Armor}, \gls{Copper}.

\paragraph{\Glsfmttext{IronOre}}

\Gls*{IronOre} is the prerequisite for \gls{Iron} a medium metal for \glspl{Weapon}, \glspl{Tool} and \glspl{Armor}.
\Gls{Iron} can also be refined into \Gls{Steel}.

\paragraph{\Glsfmttext{SilverOre}}

\Gls*{Silver} is a rare metal use to produce \gls{Merchandise}.

\paragraph{\Glsfmttext{GoldOre}}

\Gls*{Gold} is a rare metal use to produce high value \gls{Merchandise}.

\paragraph{\Glsfmttext{Coal}}

\Gls*{Coal} be mined and used as a fuel. \Gls*{Coal} is often used to refine other metals from ores.
