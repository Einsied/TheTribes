\section{\Glsfmttext{Drink}}\label{ch:Goods:Drink}

While the members of the \hyperref[ch:Tribes]{tribes} consume \gls{Food} for
sustenance, they also consume a variety of \glspl{Drink} for entertainment at a
tavern, in which case they act as \gls{Merchandise} satisfying the need for
carousing.

What makes them different from ordinary \gls{Merchandise} is the influence on
morale. A nice cold or warm \gls{Drink} after a heavy battle does not heal the
scars on the soul, but ensures the soldier feels safe and ready to fight again.
