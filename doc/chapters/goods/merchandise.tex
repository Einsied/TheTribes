\section{\Glsfmttext{Merchandise}}\label{ch:Goods:Merchandise}

The members of the \hyperref[ch:Tribes]{tribes} enjoy various articles of
\gls*{Merchandise}, like clothes or furniture. These can be categorized
according to their desirability or quality, need and their durability.
Durability describes how fast an item is worn out and needs to be replaced or
repaired. While commonly durability is thought of as the degradation of a
physical item here it also describes the consumption of an item like a drink.
So a mug of ale reaches the end of its durability, when a new one is desired.

Considering that the \hyperref[ch:Tribes]{tribes} produce a larger variety of
\gls*{Merchandise}, first the needs are described and the targets of
distribution. \Gls{Clothing} is used by an individual, while \gls{Furniture}
can be shared between multiple inhabitants of a home, so \Gls{Clothing} is
distributed to individuals while \gls{Furniture} is distributed to homes. Some
goods may provide for more than one need and the strength of the needs varies
between the \hyperref[ch:Tribes]{tribes} and their members.
