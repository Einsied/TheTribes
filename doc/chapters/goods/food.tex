\section{\Glsfmttext{Food}}\label{ch:Goods:Food}

The members of the \hyperref[ch:Tribes]{tribes} consume various forms of
\gls*{Food}, some more primitive some more elaborate, which is expressed in the
food quality\footnote{ For some of the more hierarchical
	\hyperref[ch:Tribes]{tribes} like the \gls{Aztecs} the food quality matters
	more than for others. }. The food also differ in its nutritional value.

The nutritional value governs how well the food satisfies the need for
\gls{Sustenance}, while the quality governs how well if satisfies the need for
\gls{Dining}.

% The atztecs meed at least 6 food levels for their society so it should go from 0 to 6 or lowest to highest

\begin{longtable}{lll}
	\toprule
	\Gls*{Food} & Quality level & Nutritional Value \\
	\midrule
	\Gls{Meat}  & Low           & Medium            \\
	\Gls{Fish}  & Lower         & Medium            \\
	\bottomrule
\end{longtable}
