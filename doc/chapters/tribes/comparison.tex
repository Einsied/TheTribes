	\section{Comparisons}
	For a short overview the tribes are summarized in a few tables.

	\subsection{Overview}
	These table compares the different tribes. They are not precise measurement but
	should help give a rough oversight. The entries range from \textquote{lowest}
	\textquote{lower} \textquote{low} \textquote{medium} \textquote{high}
	\textquote{higher} and \textquote{highest}.
