% # Notes
% - Fortifications should be slow to build and tear down, so they feel more meaningful
% and siege magic more mighty.
% - It should be possible to configure the equipment of soldiers in the form of templates
% preferable on the individual level
% - Having the option to start with customized starting towns/fortresses would permit player
% to create a strategy up ahead. They might invest in an early keep or a large weapons industry
% permitting them to rush. This should make matches more varied for experienced players.
% 
% Considering how much I enjoyed building and walking through cities in Spell force.
% The campaign could be made similar. 
% As an immortal the player character traverses the world recruiting randomly generated npcs.
% Between the maps he only can take a limited number of people with him through the gate or in a ship.
%
% The people he leaves behind keep living their lives and the cities change and grow a little while the AI manages them. 
% 
% If the player built the cities well he returns to flourishing lands and can recruit the children of his former followers into his retinue to fight the next battle and shop for good equipment.
% 
% He can also trade with these cities.
% This will result in a player created interactive world with mini quests and make the changes and threats more meaningful.
% 
% It is in some sense like X4 just with more RTS RPG elements.
% (Forges leveling up overtime giving better equipment, supply and demand, legions of soldiers to recruit, blueprints for buildings to buy, new cultures to encounter etc.)
% 
% Food production also ties into this as the retinues hunger makes a settlement necessary and the available farmland limits the size of the final settlement.
