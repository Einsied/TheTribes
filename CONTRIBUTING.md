Dear future contributor,
before you contribute please review the license
and consider that you are contributing to what may morph from a hobby
to a commercial project.
While I appreciate all help only the documentation will be free as in freedom
and beer for the future.
The final product may not.
If you wish to contribute anyway,
please ensure that your code is readable helpful and elegant.
Also please acknowledge in your commit that you grant permission for your
work to be used for both free and commercial usage.

Thank you for your effort friendly stranger,
hope once the project is done it will bring you and many others
a great amount of joy.
